Code for testing technologies which can be used for rich browser-based visualizations.


Links and Pointers
=====
1. See `http://tinyurl.com/kyutech131201` for slides which explain and use this code.
2. `test.****.html` are the demo files. Just drag-and-drop in browser.
3. `baseline.pdf` is the pdf file generated (parsed, actually) based on the layout generated by Graphviz's NEATO algorithm.
4. `diagrams.pdf` contains all the charts pertaining to the design.


Recommendations
=======
Use the approach in `test.ULTIMATE.html` because it provides the best trade-off between drawing and text abilities. Somehow, tests show that increasing drawing ability results in decreased textual one.
